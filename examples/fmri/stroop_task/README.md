# Stroop Task

This is a simple fast event-related design fMRI experiment. Participants are asked to
judge the colour of a word, while ignoring its meaning. Responses are given with
two buttons. Event order and length is loaded from a
[BrainVoygaer](http://brainvoyager.com) `.prt` file for each participant. At
the end of the experiment an ouput .prt file is saved, reflecting congruent,
incongruent and erroneous trials.
